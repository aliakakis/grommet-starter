# Grommet Starter
Simple Grommet based starter project using MobX

# Run
- Run npm install for all the packages to load
- The project is using Gulp therefore by executing "gulp run:dev" will create a build folder with all the 
necessary files to run the project
- Executing "gulp run:prod" will create a production ready project and with the arg "--production" further optimizations
will take place.
- Executing "gulp run:watchify" will update ONLY the javascript code. Please remember to add any new files to the gulp 
 watchify task otherwise the watcher WILL NOT RUN FOR THAT FILE.

Have Fun!!! Hope it helps.
